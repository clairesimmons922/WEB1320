        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>Since the startup of my neighbood business, I have received a number of nice reviews.  I do not actively advertise or solicit work; I prefer to let my clients speak for me. Here are some of their comments/</p>

        <h3>Jinny K.</h3>
        <p><blockquote> I had a terrific experience with Brian Eustis of Affordable Answers.  My Windows laptop was getting worse every time I turned it on and my in-house tech spouse couldn't figure it out.  I found Brian through a recommendation on [Nextdoor], dropped my laptop at his house and picked it up 36 hours later. Brian removed 3 nasty viruses that had taken over my laptop, plus made some changes to improve performance.  He also provided a written list of exactly what he had done and recommendations to ensure optimal performance and security. And didn't make me feel ignorant...</blockquote></p>

        <h3>Gail M.</h3>
        <p><blockquote>We had a wonderful experience today with Brian Eustis. We were having problems with both of our PC's as well as neither my iPhone nor iPad would send out messages. He was prompt and was here 2 hours and fixed all problems and his price was extremely reasonable. We recommend him highly.</blockquote></p>

        <h3>Tim B.</h3>
        <p><blockquote>I was traveling for work in the Atlanta area and my computer blue screened and I was out of commission.  I found that Affordable Answers was close by, so I called Brian and we made arrangements to drop off my machine.  Brian was fantastic to work with, he kept me updated along the way and gave me recommendations on items that needed to be replaced/fixed.  Since I was traveling, Brian was extremely conscientious of that fact and worked hard to make sure that he had my machine ready prior to my departure date. <br><br>
        I just so happened to have to come back the next week, so he was able to keep it over the weekend to make sure all was perfect.  The laptop has never run better and Brian did amazing work at a more than reasonable price.  I would definitely use Brian again, he is very detailed and treats his customers with an extremely high level of service.</blockquote></p>
        
        <h3>Anne B.</h3>
        <p><blockquote>Need highly competent, articulate, convenient AND affordable IT technical support? Your man is right here in our neighborhood. Brian Eustis at Affordable Answers is the one to call.  Brian makes house calls or can meet clients, and works for a very reasonable hourly fee.  He helped me with a multitude of IT issues involved with getting set up with a new laptop with new software.  I was quite pleased with his expert help and use of time as well as affordability.</blockquote></p>
        
        <h3>Dan M.</h3>
        <p><blockquote>Brian has been handling my small business IT needs for the past 6 months or so.  He has been reliable, prompt, and capable whether working remotely on on site. I would recommend him to anyone seeking an affable, capable IT professional.</blockquote></p>

        <h3>Lee S.</h3>
        <p><blockquote>Brian is always friendly, upbeat, and willing to work-in a request as soon as possible. He has good experience and a global knowledge— he can figure out things related to a problem so that any given solution makes sense in the whole picture. He is willing to spend as much time as it takes, with fair pricing—and helpful in answering a question that may come up here and there between jobs. It’s a comfort that he is available—and reliable!</blockquote></p>

        <h3>Lynn G.</h3>
        <p><blockquote>Brian came to our home, diagnosed numerous laptop problems and took the time to inform and educate patiently.  He removed a virus, reorganized an external hard drive, repaired various software issues, restored our music library and on and on.  Our laptop runs noticeably better!<br><br>
        He is reasonably priced, kind and worked quickly to resolve our laptop issues. Highly recommend Brian for thorough computer repair and assistance.<br><br>
        Thank you Carolyn W. who recommended Brian here on Nextdoor, so glad we also called him for help!</blockquote></p>
