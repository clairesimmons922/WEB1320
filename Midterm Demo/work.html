            <h1>Professional History</h1>
            <p>I spent over a decade working in hospitality and worked my way up from sales coordinator at the Holiday Inn Express in Smyrna, GA to my last position as director of sales and marketing opening the Hotel Indigo in downtown Chattanooga, TN.  Like so many people around the world, the 2020 pandemic and subsequent furlough offered me a lot of time for reflection on career and life goals.  While at home, one of the many books I devoured was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081PGMLJ8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1" target="_blank">"Wine Girl" by Victoria James</a>.  The below passage is what first led me to question the career I'd spent so much time and energy building.  (Feel free to substitute "hotel" for "restaurant" as you read)</p>

            <p><blockquote>"I told myself that I was 'used to' the environment, but really, it had instilled in me a false sense of security.  Since I was surviving as a sommelier, I thought I was fulfilled, but I had just grown complacent.  The restaurant business counts on complacency to stay alive.  Since we were all too tired to look elsewhere, we forgot about the ordinary pleasures of everyday life.  Free time, a family, personal lifeâ€”I had unknowingly sacrificed these things when I signed on.<br>
            Restaurants fetishize long hours of manual labor.  Marea could have easily hired another sommelier to lighten the burden on all of us.  Instead, we were told to take pride in our extended shifts, that it was a trophy to hold up for others to see.  The sommeliers and captains almost bragged about who worked more, unable to admit that much of our work was superfluous.  The manual labor of Marea, the sheer exhaustion, the insane pressure, all stripped me of my humanity."</blockquote>

            <p>When I returned from furlough to open a brand new hotel in the middle of a pandemic, that Victoria James quote stuck with me.  I never could quite summon enthusiasm for selling hotel rooms at a time when I barely felt safe entering a grocery store.  The pressure became unbearable and I was turning into a version of myself I didn't like very much.  In January 2021, I made the slightly scary decision to resign from my job and enroll full-time at Chattanooga State Community College to study web design and digital media.  I am so very delighted to be back in the classroom, pursuing my passion, and I'm so very relieved to no longer be spending sleepless nights hounded by anxiety.  These days, I spend my time doing fun things like building this website!  And for my next act?  Stay tuned...</p><br>
