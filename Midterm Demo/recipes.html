                    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>                
                    <li>adobo sauce from 2 cans chipotle peppers</li>

                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon red curry powder</li>

                    <li>1 bunch fresh basil</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Directions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk rice vinegar, fish sauce, grated ginger, garlic, hot sauce, red curry powder, and red curry paste in a shallow dish. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Puncture flank steak several times with a fork and place in the vinegar mixture. Cover and marinate at room temperature for at least 1 hour (I usually go overnight).</li>

                    <li>Place steak on the grill and basil on top of steak. Grill steak for 6 minutes. Remove basil, turn meat over, and place basil back on top of steak. Cook the steak until it begins to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 6 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F.</li>
                    <li>Let steak rest at least 5 minutes before carving.</li>
