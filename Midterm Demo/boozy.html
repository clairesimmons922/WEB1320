            <h1>Chattanooga Boozy Bookworms</h1>
            <p>After moving to Chattanooga, I began to miss my Atlanta bookclub very much.  I tried starting a new meetup, but never developed much of a following.  As luck would have it, another meetup organizer stepped down from an existing book club and I took over in March of 2018.  After a little rebranding, Boozy Bookworms was born.</p>

            <h2>2021 Picks</h2>

            <h3>January</h3>
            <h4>"Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg" by Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik</h4>
            <img class="books" src="images/Book Club/Notorious-RBG.jpg" alt="Notorious RBG">
                <p>She was a fierce dissenter with a serious collar game. A legendary, self-described “flaming feminist litigator” who made the world more equal. And an intergenerational icon affectionately known as the Notorious RBG. As the nation mourns the loss of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, discover the story of a remarkable woman and learn how to carry on her legacy.<br><br>
                This runaway bestseller, brought to you by the attorney founder of the Notorious RBG Tumblr and an award-winning feminist journalist, is more than just a love letter. It draws on intimate access to Ginsburg's family members, close friends, colleagues, and clerks, as well as an interview with the Justice herself. An original hybrid of reported narrative, annotated dissents, rare archival photos and documents, and illustrations, the book tells a never-before-told story of an unusual and transformative woman who transcended divides and changed the world forever.</p><br> 

            <h3>February</h3>
            <h4>"Queenie" by Candice Carty-Williams</h4>
            <img class="books" src="images/Book Club/queenie.jpg" alt="Queenie">
                <p>Queenie Jenkins is a twenty-five-year-old Jamaican British woman living in London, straddling two cultures and slotting neatly into neither. She works at a national newspaper, where she’s constantly forced to compare herself to her white middle class peers. After a messy break up from her long-term white boyfriend, Queenie seeks comfort in all the wrong places…including several hazardous men who do a good job of occupying brain space and a bad job of affirming self-worth.<br><br>
                As Queenie careens from one questionable decision to another, she finds herself wondering, “What are you doing? Why are you doing it? Who do you want to be?”—all of the questions today’s woman must face in a world trying to answer them for her.</p><br> 
            
            <h3>March</h3>
            <h4>"Vox" by Christina Dalcher</h4>
            <img class="books" src="images/Book Club/vox.jpg" alt="Vox">
                <p>Set in a United States in which half the population has been silenced, Vox is the harrowing, unforgettable story of what one woman will do to protect herself and her daughter.<br><br>
                On the day the government decrees that women are no longer allowed more than one hundred words per day, Dr. Jean McClellan is in denial. This can't happen here. Not in America. Not to her.<br><br>
                Soon women are not permitted to hold jobs. Girls are not taught to read or write. Females no longer have a voice. Before, the average person spoke sixteen thousand words each day, but now women have only one hundred to make themselves heard.<br><br>  
                For herself, her daughter, and every woman silenced, Jean will reclaim her voice.<br><br>
                This is just the beginning...not the end.</p><br> 
            
            <h3>April</h3>
            <h4>"Grown Ups" by Marian Keyes</h4>
            <img class="books" src="images/Book Club/GrownUps.jpg" alt="Grown Ups">
                <p>They're a glamorous family, the Caseys. Johnny Casey, his two brothers Ed and Liam, their beautiful, talented wives and all their kids spend a lot of time together--birthday parties, anniversary celebrations, weekends away. And they're a happy family. Johnny's wife, Jessie--who has the most money--insists on it <br><br>
                Under the surface, though, conditions are murkier. While some people clash, other people like each other far too much . . .<br><br> 
                Still, everything manages to stay under control--that is, until Ed's wife, Cara, gets a concussion and can't keep her thoughts or opinions to herself. One careless remark at Johnny's birthday party, with the entire family present, and Cara starts spilling all their secrets.<br><br> 
                As everything unravels, each of the adults finds themselves wondering if it's--finally--the time to grow up.</p><br> 
            
            <h3>May</h3>
            <h4>"The Woman in the Window" by A.J. Finn</h4>
            <img class="books" src="images/Book Club/window.jpg" alt="Window">
                    <p>Anna Fox lives alone—a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.<br><br> 
                    Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother, their teenage son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn’t, her world begins to crumble—and its shocking secrets are laid bare.<br><br> 
                    What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems.</p><br> 
            
            <h3>June 2021</h3>
            <h4>"Anxious People" by Fredrik Backman</h4>
            <img class="books" src="images/Book Club/anxious.jpg" alt="Anxious People">
            <p>Looking at real estate isn’t usually a life-or-death situation, but an apartment open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes a group of strangers hostage.<br><br> 
            The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can’t fix their own marriage. There’s a wealthy bank director who has been too busy to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can’t seem to agree on anything, from where they want to live to how they met in the first place. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment’s only bathroom, and you’ve got the worst group of hostages in the world.<br><br> 
            Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them—the bank robber included—desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next.<br><br> 
            Rich with Fredrik Backman’s “pitch-perfect dialogue and an unparalleled understanding of human nature” ( Shelf Awareness), Anxious People is an ingeniously constructed story about the enduring power of friendship, forgiveness, and hope—the things that save us, even in the most anxious times.</p><br>
