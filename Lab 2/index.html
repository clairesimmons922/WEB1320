    <h3>Baloo</h3>
    <p>My junior year of college, I visited the <a href="https://atlantahumane.org/about-us/location-and-hours/west-midtown/" target="_blank">Howell Mill Humane Society</a> to play with the puppies... famous last words!  There was a litter of 6 Chow Chow/Bernese Mountain Dog mix puppies that looked like little cotton balls with legs.  When I visited their pen, Baloo jumped into my arms.  He weighed 9.5 pounds when I brought him home.  Fifty pounds and 13 years later, we're still inseparable.</p>

        <li>Greeting guests with a toy</li>
    </ol>

    <h4> Things Baloo Doesn't Like</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Sharing</li>
        <li>Not being able to see mom</li>
        <li>Closed doors (he will bang on these)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mouse</h3>
    <p>After our honeymoon, Adam and I decided (mostly I decided) it was time for another dog.  Why not bring out animal total up to an even four?  Pet adoption has evolved quite a bit since 2008; I first saw Mouse on <a href="https://petfinder.com/" target="_blank">Pet Finder</a> and immediately fell in love with her big ears.  After writing some lengthy emails to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fairydogmotherrescue/" target="_blank">Fairy Godmother Dog Rescue</a> to confirm that Mouse was sweet and submissive enough for Baloo to tolerate living with her, Adam and I drove to Alabama to bring her home.

    <p>Baloo has really been pretty tolerant, even in the beginning when she liked to sit on him (and the cat, and us)</p>

    <p>But everything gets better with time!</p>
